I incorrectly stated that the radar cross-signature of the RQ-170 Sentinal is about the size of an eagle's eyeball.  This is incorrect.  The radar cross-section of this aircraft is unknown to me.  The eagle's eyeball reference should have attributed to the "Hopeless Diamond" shape, which I had removed from the presentation.
